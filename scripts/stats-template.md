# üèõÔ∏è Structure

Each archive repository has its contents split into nested folders and is organized by ID. Each directory, except for the repository's root, contains at most 100 directories/files, making it easy to browse on GitHub.

For example, a document with ID 12345678 will be placed in `12000000/12340000/12345600/12345678.json`  
In this case, the documented can be easily located by incrementally reading the digits of the ID:

- The ID starts with `12`, meaning it will be in `12000000/`
- The next two digits are `34`, meaning it will be in `12000000/12340000/`
- And so on...

For IDs shorter than 8 digits, directory and file names are padded at the start with `-` to ensure that Github lists directories or files in the correct order:

| # | w/o padding   | w/ padding      |
| - | ------------- | --------------- |
| 1 | `1.json`      | `-------1.json` |
| 2 | `10.json`     | `-------2.json` |
| 3 | `100.json`    | `-------3.json` |
| 4 | `2.json`      | `-------4.json` |
| 5 | `20.json`     | `-------5.json` |
| 6 | `200.json`    | `-------6.json` |

For example, a document with ID 1234 will be placed in `-------0/-------0/----1200/----1234.json`
