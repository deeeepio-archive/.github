# üèõÔ∏è Structure
Each archive repository has its contents split into nested folders and is organized by ID. Each directory, except for the repository's root, contains at most 100 directories/files, making it easy to browse on GitHub. 

For example, a document with ID 12345678 will be placed in `12000000/12340000/12345600/12345678.json`  
In this case, the documented can be easily located by incrementally reading the digits of the ID:
- The ID starts with `12`, meaning it will be in `12000000/`
- The next two digits are `34`, meaning it will be in `12000000/12340000/`
- And so on...
